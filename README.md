# Boundary-Detection-using-Pb-lite
 The objective of this project is to implement a simplified
 version of the PB-lite boundary detection algorithm, where
 ”Pb” stands for Probability of Boundary. The algorithm lever
ages texture, brightness, and color information at multiple
 scales to improve upon the Sobel and Canny baseline methods.
 The algorithm can be divided into four steps:
 1) Generation of Filter bank
 2) Generation of Texton, Brightness, and Color maps
 3) Generation of Texton, Brightness, and Color gradient
 maps
 4) Boundary detection using the maps, Sobel, and Canny
 baseline
