# Boundary-Detection-using-Pb-lite
This project investigates computer vision techniques
across two distinct phases: traditional boundary detection meth-
ods and neural network optimization. Phase 1 examines the
creation and implementation of diverse filter banks for im-
age processing. Phase 2 focuses on enhancing neural network
performance through advanced architectural modifications and
optimization strategies.
